# GUI-Calculator
This project is a simulation fo a simple Calculator using GUI with the support of Javax Swing
This calculator can do simple calculation, such as addition, substraction, multiplication, and division.
In the future, I will try my best to add more features and advanced math functions like sine, cosine, or tan.
I look forward to hearing people's feedbacks on my implementation and any other ideas.
